    <br>
    <p class="texto">The Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) is a proprietary game engine of Rockstar Games
    , developed by the RAGE Technology Group division of Rockstar San Diego. Since its first game, Rockstar
    Games Presents Table Tennis in 2006, released for the Xbox 360 and Wii, the engine has been used by
    Rockstar Games' internal studios to develop advanced open world games for consoles and computers.</p>

    <p class="texto2">Prior to developing the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE), Rockstar Games, and primarily
    its Rockstar North studio, mostly used Criterion Games' RenderWare engine to develop games for PlayStation
    2, Windows, and Xbox, such as the early 3D installments in the Grand Theft Auto franchise. In 2004
    , Criterion Games was acquired by Electronic Arts, which led Rockstar Games to switch from RenderWare,
    and open RAGE Technology Group as a division of Rockstar San Diego. RAGE Technology Group started
    developing what would later become RAGE, based on Rockstar San Diego's previous Angel Game Engine (AGE).
    The first game to use the engine was Rockstar San Diego's Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis,
    released for Xbox 360 on May 23, 2006 and ported to the Wii more than a year later. Since then,
    RAGE integrates the third-party middleware components Euphoria and Bullet, as character animation
    engine and physics engine, respectively.</p>
